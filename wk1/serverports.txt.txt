What is the definition of server port?
-A port number is a way to identify a specific process to which an Internet or other network message is to be forwarded when it arrives at a server.

What is server port range?
-Port numbers range from 0 to 65535, but only port numbers 0 to 1023 are reserved for privileged services and designated as well-known ports.

How many bits does number above represent?
-The most common is hexadecimal. In hexadecimal notation, 4 bits (a nibble) are represented by a single digit. There is obviously a problem with this since 4 bits gives 16 possible combinations, and there are only 10 unique decimal digits, 0 to 9.
